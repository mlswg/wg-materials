The MLS WG will maintain the protocol (see RFC 9420) and will work on the
following MLS protocol extensions:

* Support for use of MLS in protocols developed by the MIMI working group
* Support for new credential types
* Support for common operational patterns in messaging applications
* Support for quantum resistance
* Framework for safe extensibility
* Detection of lost application messages
* Support for sending messages to individual members of a group

Many of extensions to support these features will be included in
draft-ietf-mls-extensions, but some of the extensions will be published in
seperate specifications.


Milestones:

- Dec 2024: Submit MLS extensions I-D to IESG as Proposed Standard
