# PRs

#527 Stronger parent hashes for authenticated identities

* @TWal and @bifurcation to get to a merge-able state, then make decision on mailing list

#587 Stop generating redundant PKE key pairs.

* Ready to merge
* Refactor parent hash validation in a follow-up

#592 Add a simple ProofCredential alternative to Certificate.

* On the one hand, could implement this in a follow-on spec
* On the other hand, could be nice to avoid the need for implementations to add stuff off the bat
* TODO(@Bren2010): Flesh out use cases

#593 Clean up the description of tree evolution.

* To @rohan-wire's concern: This allows the base path secret to be derived, e.g., using a KDF, so this doesn't necessarily increase the amount of entropy needed
* Clear to merge

#594 TLS syntax updates

* Some concern about being able to send gigantic stuff
  * In adversarial cases, the 4-byte headers used for a lot of stuff might already be a problem
  * Could also have length constraints decoupled from the syntax
  * SIP experience shows that imposing arbitrary length limits isn't a good idea
  * ... but applications should have a way to signal that things are too big
  * TODO(@bifurcation): Advisory text "Beware, things can get big; consider imposing limits and clear failure cases for this"
  * Consider streaming implementations, where you might not know that the whole message fits in memory
* Modulo the above TODO, clear to merge

#595 Allowlist approach for proposals in external commit

* Merged

#597 Require Commit.path by default

* OK to keep using type
* TODO(@bifurcation) "path safe" -> "path required"
* Otherwise clear to merge

# Issues

#596 Invert definition of "partial" commit

* Fixed by #597

#591 Reinit logic clarification

* Maybe put "remove before upgrade" in implementation considerations document.
* (after meeting) Tom good to close this one out

#589 Replace labeled signing with signing wire format?

* What's important is to have a "magic string" that distinguishes this protocol from other protocols
* Need to distinguish between
  * Different structures within MLS
  * Different versions of MLS
  * MLS vs. everything else
* E.g., "MLS 1.0 KeyPackageTBS" ~> protocol / version / type
* In addition to already having it, having the protocol distinguisher in ASCII gives greater confidence
  * "Intra-protocol" identifiers can be small
  * "Inter-protocol" identifiers need to be larger to reduce collision probability
  * Consider introducing some standard prefix to "MLS"
* If we're going to have both ASCII distinguisher and wire_format, spec needs to enforce equivalence
  * Could also omit wire_format from signature and rely on ASCII distinguisher alone
  * TODO(@TWal) Check that this is clear in the spec, see if wire format should be omitted

#588 external_key_id seems to have a double usage

* TODO(@bifurcation) Sender.external_key_id -> Sender.id or something like that

#559 Remove redundant nodes from the tree

* Fixed by #587
