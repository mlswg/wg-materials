#584 Move validation of identity change to the AS 

* Bullet about Update seems redundant given the changes to the first bullet. It is also out of place here in KeyPackage validation, since there might not be an update.
* TODO(@kkohbrok) Remove this bullet, then clear to merge

#583 Fix tables in IANA section

* Merged

#582 Figure 1 is more accurate showing init_secret as start and end secrets. 

* epoch->epoch better for newcomers
* Closed

#581 Add message/mls MIME type registration 

* Merged

#580 Move definition of blank node earlier into ## Ratchet Tree Terminology 

* Merged

#579 Enforce uniqueness of PreSharedKeyIDs in PreSharedKey proposals 

* Merged

#575 Split LeafNode from KeyPackage 

* @raphaelrobert points out that a Commit+Add might be processed some time after it is created, so the lifetime might have expired
* @Bren2010 notes that a lifetime in the leaf node at least provides a signal as to how old the leaf is (notBefore being more useful than notAfter here, since it roughly corresponds to creation time)
* TODO(@bifurcation): Implement the following, then merge:
  * Leave lifetime in LeafNode
  * MUST verify lifetime when creating an Add from a prepublished KP
  * SHOULD verify lifetime when receive an Add (modulo time skew between send and receive)
  * SHOULD NOT enforice lifetime when receiving a tree
* It's also possible to put a "last updated epoch" in the leaf alongside the group ID, useful?
  * Doesn't obviously correspond to time, use cases not obvious
  * No action for now
